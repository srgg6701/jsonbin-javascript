#JSONbin javascript interface

It allows to use the [free jsonbin.org RESTful service] (https://jsonbin.org) via JS interface. 

Before that you have to obtain your User name and API key from the service.

In order to implement POST and PATCH queries you should put data into the corresponding textarea in valid JSON format like this:

```json
{
  "property" : "value"
}
```
Happy coding! :)
